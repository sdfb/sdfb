	  <p><strong>1. The site is slow and/or something&#39;s not working.</strong></p>
<p><em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> is currently in beta testing phase.  One of the known issues with our beta site is the length of time it requires to construct our visualization.  Please be advised that this is particularly problematic if you attempt to use a low certainty threshold to search the entire network.</p>
      <p>If you encounter any other problems or have any other suggestions for how to improve the site, please let us know by clicking the <em>Provide Feedback</em> link in the header bar.	  </p>
      <p><a name="0.2_autocomplete"></a>      </p>
      <p><strong>2. Why does the auto-complete in the search bar include a number after every name?</strong></p>
<p>To help users disambiguate between people with multiple names, the auto-complete function in our search bar includes the person&#39;s birthdate in parentheses after their names.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.3_edit"></a></p>
      <p><strong>3. Why can&#39;t I contribute/edit anything?</strong></p>
      <p>Anyone can search and see the <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> network, however only registered users may contribute to and edit the network.  Please make sure you&#39;re signed in, either by clicking the <em>Sign In</em> link in the header bar or by clicking the <em>Sign In</em> link on the error page generated when you attempt to create/edit while not signed in.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.4_signup"></a></p>
      <p><strong>4. Where do I sign up?  What are your Terms of Service?</strong></p>
      <p>If you click the <em>Sign In</em> link in the header bar, you should see an option to <em>Sign Up</em> for a new account.  Terms of Service are also linked to the <em>Sign In</em> and <em>Sign Up</em> pages.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.5_data"></a></p>
      <p><strong>5. Can I access the <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> data directly?  What is its copyright status?</strong></p>
      <p>All our data sets are freely viewable and downloadable for registered users.  Click the <em>View Records</em> link in the header to see a drop-down menu of the different data sets.  Click to bring up the data set you&#39;re interested in, which you can then either browse online or click the <em>Export</em> button to download the data to your computer.</p>

      <p><a name="0.2_0.6_contribution"></a></p>
      <p><strong>6. Why didn&#39;t my contribution immediately show up on the visualization?</strong></p>
      <p><em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> is not a wiki-style platform.  All contributions to the website must be first approved by an Admin or Curator before appearing in the visualization.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.7_curator"></a></p>
      <p><strong>7. Who are the Curators and how do I become one?</strong></p>
      <p>The <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> Curators are users who have shown consistent ability to make useful contributions to the website, or users who have been otherwise vetted by the Admins.  The process of &quot;unlocking&quot; Curator status will eventually become automated, but in the beta version of this site requires Admin research and approval.  If you are interested in becoming a Curator, please contact the Admins <a href="mailto:SixDegreesFrancisBacon@gmail.com?subject=Applying+for+Curator+Status" target="_blank">via email</a>.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.8_filters"></a></p>
      <p><strong>8. What are the filters at the top of the page?</strong></p>
      <p>After searching for a particular subset of the data, you may wish to refine your search.  Rather than performing the search over again from scratch, you may use the filters for certainty and date to tweak those parameters.  Click on either the word <em>Certainty</em> or <em>Date</em>, adjust the sliders to the numbers you want, then click the <em>Find</em> button.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.9_blank"></a></p>
      <p><strong>9. Why are fields in the sidebar blank when I click on a person or relationship?</strong></p>
      <p>Many of the fields in our data sets are empty, particularly the group data sets and the relationship type/date data sets.  This is where <em>you</em> come in.  Please consider clicking the pen icons in the sidebar accordian to annotate or edit our existing data.  Please also consider adding new people, relationships, and groups via the Contribute button in the sidebar accordian.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.10_group"></a></p>
      <p><strong>10. Why does searching on a group not bring up all the people who I know should be in that group?</strong></p>
      <p>The ability to search by groups is limited by whether or not people have been tagged as belonging to those groups.  At present, only our gender groups - Female, Male, Other - have been fully tagged.  This is where <em>you</em> come in.  Please consider adding new people to existing groups via the tag icon in the group section of the sidebar accordian.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.11_ODNB"></a></p>
      <p><strong>11. What is the Oxford DNB?  Why don&#39;t the Oxford DNB links take me directly to biographies?</strong></p>
      <p>The <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> is a subscription-only website.  Many universities and public libraries have subscriptions.  If you are in the UK, you should be able to access it from any public library.  If you are affiliated with a university or college, and not currently on campus, try logging on remotely to your campus library/network to see if your university or college has a subscription.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.12_IDs"></a></p>
      <p><strong>12. What are all the ID numbers that display in the data sets?</strong></p>
      <p>Each person, relationship, and group in the <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> data sets have identifiers to help disambiguate people with the same or similar names.  Some people also have ODNB IDs, which identify them in the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> database.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.13_type"></a></p>
      <p><strong>13. What does birth or death year &quot;type&quot; mean?  What if I don&#39;t know the exact year or the multiple early modern calendars makes the year ambiguous?</strong></p>
      <p>Since historical birth and death dates are so often ambiguous, <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> has implemented a system to deal with this.  Users can choose between BF (before), IN, AF (after), CA (circa), or a combination of BF/IN, AF/IN.  So, for example, a person born in or before 1600 should be listed as BF/IN with an Ext(ant) Birth Year of 1600.  A person born around 1540 should be listed as CA with an Ext Birth Year of 1540.</p>
      <p>If you have a person who you know was born in a range of years - such as between 1630 and 1635 - you can use the Alt Birth Year field to indicate a close date for that range.  This field can also be used for persons born between Jan. 1 and Mar. 25, whose birth year depends on which date you choose for New Year&#39;s Day</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.14_justification"></a></p>
      <p><strong>14. What should I put in the &quot;justification&quot; box?</strong></p>
      <p>This is where you should provide the citation for your information or otherwise indicate why it ought to be approved and added to the visualization.  This information will remain linked to your contribution for future users to see.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.15_approved"></a></p>
      <p><strong>15. What is the &quot;is approved&quot; check-box for?</strong></p>
      <p>Admins and Curators can see a checkbox labeled &quot;Is Approved.&quot;  Clicking this box will enable their contribution to go directly into the visualization.</p>
      <p><a name="0.2_0.16_other"></a></p>
      <p><strong>16. I have some other question.</strong></p>
      <p>Please use the <em>Provide Feedback</em> link in the header to contact us and explain what is currently confusing/unclear to you about the site.</p>
